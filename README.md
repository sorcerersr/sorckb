This repository contains the files for my self build ortholinear keyboard.

## Layout

The layout is intended to be used with the 'us-altgr-intl' keymap to benefit from 
a developer friendly english base layout but also have the opportunity to write german umlauts
accessible on a different layer. There are two layers: a upper and a lower layer.
